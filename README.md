The source files for the game M-Island


The game is developed in Gdev5 so I have provided the code from the file I could. Given the amount of effort put into the 
game I should have likily left more time to focus on this part of 'brief'.

I hope you enjoy the game and for more free indie games please visit www.gamesbyjack.co.uk

thanks
